# Growtopia-Trainer-v3.91

This Trainer Works Only In Growtopia Version: 3.91
You need to update opcodes by yourself when outdates

This Trainer is not good, i decided to make public source trainer because
many people doesnt know how to make altough it is very easy.

When you open this project on Visual Studio, Right click solution 'KissaTrainer' then click Restore Nuget Packages.
